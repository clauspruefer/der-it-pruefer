# Intro

Last week on 17.07.2024 the **WeAreDevelopers World Congress** started. As its name implies: we are talking about "Developing
(Applications)" and everything connected. I really had not been aware of the congress being that big. As we were able to leak
some data, the number of visitors exceeded the 10k (*10.000*) threshold.

> Our company also should have had some tech talk on the event, but due to some circumstances we were not able to finish the 
requirements in time ::sheduled for next year, so get your tickets early.

# Entering the Arena

I am really a bit excited. Whats expecting me? It is indeed the first time I visit the congress. Installed the handy-app on Tuesday
and got multiple contact requests which I am looking forward to meet until Friday when the congress will be over.

I take the S-Bahn (Ring) and get out *ICC Messe Nord*. I do not want to change trains, so I walk some minutes more to Messe Süd to
get a better geographical understanding of the complete berlin-exhibition-territory. Passing the Messe-Nord-ICC building, it looks
quite ghostlike. It seems no one had been here for years.

You have to check this out if you are in the area ::watchable. ![EmojiMicroscope](/emoji_microscope_50x50.png)

Walking some minutes more, I arrive at the "Main Building A"; many people also are coming in from this direction.
I suddenly realize: wrong entrance. First I have to go to the South-Entrance to get my badge and identification-card before I will
transform into a 100% event attendee.

Now arriving at the South-Entrance walking through the entrance-corridor, everybody seems to be in a good mood, also the people
giving out the badges. The weather is excellent too, so this increases my mood-o'meter to intense-green-level.

![MyIdentificationCard](/wad_congress_clauspruefer_identification_card.jpg)

# Day 1 (Thursday)

After going up the moving stairs with my fresh badge and identification-card, it feels very comfortable compared e.g. to AWS Summit 
or similar. Also there are lots of people and many stages the allover impression: very structured.

After going up the stairway, I enter hall 2 to the right.

## Tech Talk Hall 2 / Stage 5

Here, **STAGE 5** is located. My goal is to connect to as many people to get freelance-jobs and to advertise my projects.
So tech-talk is no priority for me. Sometimes I stopped at a stage if there were real interesting things or when I needed a rest
at the main stage.

## Idealo

First contact point: Idealo. A german least-price search engine. I wonder what Idealo is doing on such an event. I have a very nice
talk to a marketing representative who is solving the riddle: 100% pure marketing.

An ultimate rare item, one idealo pair of socks is handed over to me, this is the thing I least thought about when visiting the congress,
but: cool! ![EmojiHeartEyes](/emoji_heart_eyes_16x16.png)![EmojiHeartEyes](/emoji_heart_eyes_16x16.png)![EmojiHeartEyes](/emoji_heart_eyes_16x16.png)

![SocksIdealo](/wad_congress_socks_idealo.jpg)

Visit: [http://idealo.de](http://idealo.de) if you are searching for the lowest tech-hardware prices.

## Influx Data

Influx Data promises extraordinary fast, scalable cloud databases. Also the website states out that you can download an open-source
version. Sorry, I did not find it. Finally I got my second pair of socks (database-socks) and some stickers, great!

It seems there is a lot of additional content, so I should move on quickly.

Visit: [http://influxdata.com](http://influxdata.com) if you are interested in big-data databases.

## Valkey

Valkey, an Open Source, in-memory high-performance data-store by the Linux Foundation. Pure Open Source, nice. Immediately check out if
the product is compareable to AWS DynamoDB wich I used quite often in projects and like a lot.

If like promised, multiple Redis engineers joined the project and pushed it to the next level. Like told, I will have a detailed look later,
but I somehow have the feeling that some current parts of technology develop into the right direction.

The next days work will include a repository clone and setup on Minicube / Kubernetes to get detailed insights.

**Website**: [http://valkey.io](http://valkey.io).<br>
**Github**: [http://github.com/valkey-io/valkey](http://github.com/valkey-io/valkey).

I got this real cool sticker, a nice keychain and also a USB-C universal adapter cable, big up dudes!

![ValkeySticker](/wad_congress_valkey_sticker.jpg)

## Pulumi

After visiting Influx Data these PulumI guys do not have givaways: intolerable! I expected another pair of socks, but I just get a
flyer with technology information.

> But: the content indeed looks nice, if they promise what is printed on the flyer, the product could be very helpful as middleware
between cloud infrastructure. And they promise much better handling of temporarily generated auth tokens. 

We will have a closer look later on. I am really not sure if such a middleware makes the whole infrastructure setup process more
complex or not (compared to structured infrastructure configuration data like JSON, XML or YAML).

Somehow PulumI always remembers me on Pelmeni.

**Website**: [http://pulumi.com](http://pulumi.com).

## Dynatrace

Dynatrace built a stargate on their stage!

What does that mean? Someone jumps in and tells me:
"You have to solve the mistery! Hahaaa!" and hands out a flyer where I must get multiple rubber stamps for.
"If you pass all tests you can pass the stargate and get a t-shirt as a gift".

![EmojiMuscle](/emoji_muscle_50x50.png)![EmojiMuscle](/emoji_muscle_50x50.png)![EmojiMuscle](/emoji_muscle_50x50.png)

![DynatraceQuest](/wad_congress_dynatrace_quest.jpg)

As you can see: I managed all 4 parts and got a cool t-shirt (not as cool as the docker one, but still cool).

A clever marketing strategy. You have to dive into the product quite deeply. Very friendly and competent engineering staff.
Shouts to Mert and Sveva, they also seemed to unerstand my new invented true OOP JavaScript design approach.

Also I got some nice stickers.

![DynatraceSticker](/wad_congress_dynatrace_sticker.jpg)

## Docker

The docker team came with outstanding logos on the freshest t-shirts on earth. But no chance for attendees to get one.
Strict member-policy ... Solely this logo will make Docker great again.

All tries failed, even telling that I am a famous DJ or that I built the fastest application-server worldwide or I am docker champion ...
No shirt, damn it ... Well, nice talk to the docker representative about tattoos by the way.

Due to porting our x0-framework to Kubernetes I am quite cmd-line Docker-experienced so the conversation stayed with our tattoos.

**Website**: [http://docker.io](http://docker.io).

Finally I got a Docker cubic ... Also quite cool. Many thanx Dan!

![DockerCubic](/wad_congress_docker_cubic.jpg)

> Upcoming on **der-it-pruefer**: "How to build a suitable devops friendly docker-app-update-strategy with debian packaging and *aptly* Debian Mirror".

## SEW-Eurodrive

SEW-Eurodrive. An evolving german company with *old* engineering skills mixed with *agile* ones. I talked to Ruben who gave me
interesting insights about the company. Products look like they have been engineered in an excelent way.

The plan: recheck the next day.

**Website**: [http://sew-eurodrive.de](http://sew-eurodrive.de).

## Red Hat

Also Red Hat is a must. Yieeha, I own a red hat from now on. Sorry, no picture, I already gave it away as a gift, hats just do
not suite me.

Nevertheless, if you plan to run big Kubernetes Infrastructure, Red Hat will help you out using their **OpenShift** product. Also
they will support you in the complete setup process.

> By wearing the red hat: no Kubernetes headaches any longer!

# Break

Always take a break. If the sun comes out, temperatures feel quite high currently.
Why did no company provide a mini-refridgerator with integrated cocktails as giveaway: damn. Propose for the next congress.

## Main Stage

The Main Stage with or without ongoing lectures is a nice place to take a rest. The sound design is excellent, always enough
space to sit down on a chair in the middle or on the galleries built around.

<video src="http://192.168.56.102:4000/wad_congress_main_stage-h264.mp4" width="800" height="600" type="video/mp4" controls></video>

## Coffee

You also could rest inside or even outside on floor 1, main building A. In total the coffee you got on the event: first class.
It is located at the end of the floor on the following video (slightly not visible, sorry).

## Catering

The catering: really awful. High prices, bad food quality. Tried to eat a **Mexican** Burito, the worst food I ever ate in my life.
Had to throw it away. I really care about not wasting food, but here I had no option.

> Berlin, Schönhauser Allee / Eberswalder Straße "Taco Love": this is where you get **real tasty** Mexican food really made
> with much love inside!

Exceptional cases: I ate a bagel inside hall 2 which tasted really good; hopefully not the bagel from "Everything Is Everywhere
All At Once".

I also was asked if I would like additional fresh lime in my mineral water. One sales stand even handed me out some ice cubes.

# Day 2 (Friday)

Appointment Day. I have 3 appointments with recruiting specialists today. This seems like the current IT-Hype, providing
expirienced manpower on demand (MPaaS) for companies. Lets see.

## Sosafe

SoSafe provides psychological training for your companies employees to reduce the risk of clicking on trojan-malware-links.

Hm, different concept. I am no fan of IPS because of false positives. That makes me aware: in over 90% breaches layer-8 is
responsible for letting our h4x0r friends in.

**Website**: [http://sosafe-awareness.com](http://sosafe-awareness.com).

## Neon

Scalable Postgres. A dream comes true. A stable, Kubernetes ready for use version has been released. Configure as many
compute pods as you like, additionally *auto-up-scale* / *auto-down-scale* feature is supported.

> Hurray, its Open Source!

*Branching* capability and apx. *1 second database setup-time* features sound interesting as well.

**Website**: [https://neon.tech](https://neon.tech).<br>
**Github**: [http://github.com/neondatabase/neon](http://github.com/neondatabase/neon).

Also the stickers are king.

![NeonStickers](/wad_congress_neon_stickers.jpg)

And the gymmicks.

![NeonGymmicks](/wad_congress_neon_gymmicks.jpg)

## Agiledrop

MPaaS from Slovenia, they provide you with PHP and JavaScript developers if you need manpower for a project.

I got fitness-bands as giveaway. Interesting concept, sports in developing-breaks. A similar community sports-arts
concept was introduced by Bauhaus in 1919. Get developers to practice more sports, exemplary!

**Website**: [http://agiledrop.com](http://agiledrop.com).

> Or use it like: whip whip whip your superior ::fired.

![AgiledropFitnessBands](/wad_congress_agiledrop_fitness_bands.jpg)

## Aerospike

A high-scalable cloud database with promised < 1msec query response times and infinite scalability.

I have a nice chat with a core developer. After finishing this article this database must also be tested.

**Website**: [http://aerospike.com](http://aerospike.com).

The sticker looks like old russian stable rocket science ::like it!

![AerospikeRocket](/wad_congress_aerospike_rocket.jpg)

## Positional

Positional provides advanced SEO / Marketing Services for companies. I talked to the founder from UK about the current
market situation and possible cooperation aspects.

They provide strategical, fundamental knowledge about business growth and the corresponding toolset. If you plan to extend
your company, Positional could be the right choice for you.

**Website**: [http://positional.com](http://positional.com).

## RWE

I had a very interesting talk to one of the RWE Chief Engineers.

I told him about my C++ Web-Application-Server (AS component using Python Interpreter) and JavaScript framework project,
especially my brand-new HTTP/1.2 implementation.

I of course agree, it is definately not production ready and needs much RFP, RFC work for me. But I really can not
agree with the HTTP/3 specs which use UDP as transmission protocol, so I will keep up the fight.

**HTTP/1.2** project Website: [http://github.com/WEBcodeX1/http-1.2](http://github.com/WEBcodeX1/http-1.2)<br>
**x0 Framework** Website: [http://github.com/WEBcodeX1/x0](http://github.com/WEBcodeX1/x0)

Side-effect: I get equipment for optimized cocktail drinking (metal drinking straws including cleaning equipment).
Thats nice. I have to propose the mini-refridgerator to RWE marketing for the next congress ![HeartEyes](/emoji_heart_eyes_16x16.png).

**RWE Website**: [http://rwe.com](http://rwe.com)

![RWECocktailEquipment](/wad_congress_rwe_cocktail_equipment.jpg)

## SEW-Eurodrive #2

SEW Eurodrive second part. Talking to a Technician / Data Scientist today. Its about Python and Data Analysis. In his oppinion
Python is not suited for multi-threaded execution because of the Global Interpreter Lock for Data-Analysis.

Thats definately true, but Python indeed is very good suited for complex OOP based, recursive JSON data structure analysis /
transformation. I doubt that the code you will write in other non-native JSON languages can be defined as *clean*. Also multiple
different ways exist to circumvent the GIL problem, e.g. the transparent *multiprocess* library which calls are 1:1 to the 
*mutithread* library or AWS lambda with Python or similar where you do map / reduce with the data distributed to the Lambda pods.

My **Falcon AS** application server also uses MultI Process Based Python Interpreters, so the GIL is no bottleneck here.

For problem solving, my oppinion is: everybody should use the programming language he is the most familiar and fastest with.
Sometimes it really does not matter, in some special cases or a really big codebase: it **does** matter.

> And do not forget: many people working on the same codebase take much longer if you would do it alone. Do calculate this
overhead.

## E.ON

Also german energy gigant E.ON is present searching for developers. I talk to some specialized staff about my carrier experience.

I will get back to them, maybe there is work waiting for me in the E.ON space. Lets see.

**Website**: [http://eon.com](http://eon.com)

![EmojiBulb](/emoji_bulb_50x50.png)![EmojiBulb](/emoji_bulb_50x50.png)![EmojiBulb](/emoji_bulb_50x50.png)

## Expert Minds

Expert Minds also provide MPaaS, but with a specialized AI driven scoring engine. This engine gets trained permanently with
detailed developer properties to get the best results for your development needs. This sounds very interesting.

I am talking with the CEO about current market situation and future development expectations. He seems to have a very good
insight about current trends and also a good understanding where the journey will take us in the future.

Check out the website if you have precise developer demand.

**Website**: [http://xprt-minds.com](http://xprt-minds.com)

## OPNTEC

The only embedded project on the event. Why? I would guess: the framework hype. How many percent of the developers have written
a linux kernel module, a high-speed server or similar? But I should not judge.

A very sympathic CEO is selling embedded hardware here. I talk a bit about my application-server written in C++ and get the idea
to port it to one type of the hardware. We need an Ethernet module. RAW packet processing, I did this some time ago on Arduino, but
I assume a small IP stack, maybe an existing one is needed. I am Internet Protocol expert, so this should not be a problem at all.

Lets start the project! I will get in touch with you the next days.

# Outside Stage

The tiny little outside stage, like it.

# Summary

After mighty AWS ruling the Cloud Market for decades it looks like alternative products coming up.
This will push the Hybrid-Cloud approach though companies are able to run things easily on-premise infrastructure.

> Additional side-effect: Security could be increased on correct IP-segment separation.

Also the WeAreDevelopers Handy-App (powered by Swapcard) is a very good tool to interconnect with event participants.

![EmojiCloud](/emoji_cloud_50x50.png)![EmojiCloud](/emoji_cloud_50x50.png)![EmojiCloud](/emoji_cloud_50x50.png)

## Open Source Concept

The open source concept seems to be understood by a wide variety of companies.

It is fundamentally important for engineering in big environments to test implementation with a dozen of
interfaces before deciding to use a new brand in production environment.

> Ah, does not work? Just update to the latest Microsoft Server version dude. And do not forget to restart!

After positive testing, it is no question to hire the right experts for implementation / optimization and also
signing the correct SLA to ensure proper operation, hand in hand with DevOps.

> Now you get things done, otherwise not.

![EmojiSatellite](/emoji_satellite_50x50.png)![EmojiSatellite](/emoji_satellite_50x50.png)![EmojiSatellite](/emoji_satellite_50x50.png)

## Failed Companies

Suse seems to do Kubernetes stuff now. Oh my gosh, it seems they missed the market.

> Remember YAST? **Y**et **A**nother **S**upreme **T**isaster.

## Security

Not really sightable throughout the whole event. The following workshop: extraordinary interesting, but I really did not
have enough time to visit: "Writing an exploit using AI".

Whoa, that sounds scary. Maybe the referees tested it on Microsoft Windows at the Berlin Airport that day, haha.

## Next Big Things

The following products tend to get the next IT-Hype of the following year:

- Neon
- Valkey
- Dynatrace
