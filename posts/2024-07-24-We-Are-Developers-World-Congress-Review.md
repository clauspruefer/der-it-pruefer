# WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2024: The IT-Prüfer Experience

Last week, on July 17th, 2024, the **WeAreDevelopers World Congress** kicked off in Berlin. As the name suggests, it’s all about “Developing Applications” and everything that powers this ecosystem. I was truly surprised by the scale—the number of attendees reportedly exceeded the 10,000 mark.

> Our company had planned a tech talk at the event, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we couldn’t finish our requirements in time. We’re scheduled for next year—so get your tickets early!

## Entering the Arena

Excitement was running high—it was my first visit to the Congress. I installed the event’s app on Tuesday and immediately received several contact requests, which I looked forward to following up before the Congress wrapped up on Friday.

I took the S-Bahn (Ring), disembarking at *ICC Messe Nord*. Instead of changing trains, I opted for a longer walk to Messe Süd to get my bearings around Berlin’s sprawling exhibition grounds. Passing the Messe-Nord-ICC building felt eerie—almost abandoned.

If you’re ever nearby, it’s worth a look. ![EmojiMicroscope](/emoji_microscope_50x50.png)

After a few more minutes, I arrived at “Main Building A,” joining a crowd moving in the same direction. Then—reality check: wrong entrance. First, you must go to the South Entrance for your badge and ID before you become an official attendee.

Arriving at the South Entrance, I walked through the corridor—everyone in high spirits, including the staff handing out badges. The weather was perfect, which boosted the mood even more.

## Day 1 (Thursday): Stages, Socks & Stickers

With badge in hand, I ascended the moving stairs. Compared to other events, like AWS Summit, the atmosphere was comfortable and highly organized, with plenty of stages and an impressive crowd.

### Tech Talk Hall 2 / Stage 5

**Stage 5** was my first stop. My main goal: networking—freelance opportunities, project promotion. Tech talks weren’t my priority, but I paused for interesting sessions or when I needed a break.

### Idealo

First up: Idealo, Germany’s price comparison engine. What were they doing at a developer congress? Pure marketing, as explained by their rep. Unexpected highlight: a pair of Idealo socks—never thought I'd leave with those!

Visit: [idealo.de](http://idealo.de) for the lowest tech hardware prices.

### Influx Data

Influx Data showcased ultra-fast, scalable cloud databases. The website claims you can download an open-source version, but I couldn’t find it. Still, I scored a second pair of socks (database-themed!) and some stickers.

Visit: [influxdata.com](http://influxdata.com) for big data solutions.

### Valkey

Valkey is an open-source, in-memory high-performance datastore backed by the Linux Foundation—think Redis, but next-gen. Promises of innovation and community-driven development piqued my interest; I plan to test it on Minikube/Kubernetes soon.

Cool swag: sticker, keychain, and USB-C adapter—thanks, Valkey team!

![ValkeySticker](/wad_congress_valkey_sticker.jpg)

### Pulumi

Pulumi’s booth had no giveaways—unacceptable! I was hoping for socks, but only got a flyer. However, their promise of streamlined cloud infrastructure management and improved handling of temporary auth tokens is intriguing.

Website: [pulumi.com](http://pulumi.com)

### Dynatrace

Dynatrace went all-out with a “stargate” challenge. Complete the quest, collect stamps, and win a t-shirt—clever marketing and friendly staff. Shoutout to Mert and Sveva for insights into my new OOP JavaScript design approach.

![DynatraceSticker](/wad_congress_dynatrace_sticker.jpg)

### Docker

Docker’s team rocked the coolest t-shirts—but strict member-only policy meant no shirts for attendees. Even boasting DJ credentials couldn’t score me one! Still, I had a great chat about dev tattoos and got a Docker cube.

### SEW-Eurodrive

SEW-Eurodrive blends classic and agile engineering. After chatting with Ruben, I planned a follow-up for deeper technical insights.

Website: [sew-eurodrive.de](http://sew-eurodrive.de)

### Red Hat

Red Hat was a must-visit. I received a red hat (now gifted away) and learned about OpenShift for Kubernetes management—no more headaches.

## Break Time: Rest, Refreshments & Reality Checks

When the sun’s out, take a break. No company offered a mini-fridge with cocktails—something to propose for next year!

### Main Stage

The main stage was an excellent place to recharge—great acoustics, plenty of seating.

### Coffee

Resting inside or outside on Floor 1, Main Building A, I found first-class coffee at the end of the corridor (sadly not visible in my video).

### Catering

The catering was disappointing—high prices, poor quality. My attempt at a “Mexican” burrito was a culinary low point. However, a bagel in Hall 2 was surprisingly good.

> For real Mexican food in Berlin, go to “Taco Love” at Schönhauser Allee / Eberswalder Straße.

Exceptional service: lime in my mineral water and ice cubes at a few stands.

Follow-up with a SEW Eurodrive data scientist focused on Python and data analysis. While Python’s GIL is a challenge for multithreading, it excels for recursive JSON operations. Multiprocessing and cloud approaches offer workarounds.

# Summary: Cloud, Open Source & The Next Big Things

With AWS dominating the cloud market for years, alternatives are rising—fueling hybrid cloud adoption and empowering on-premise setups.

> Bonus: Improved security via proper IP segmentation.

The WeAreDevelopers app (powered by Swapcard) was a standout networking tool.

![EmojiCloud](/emoji_cloud_50x50.png)![EmojiCloud](/emoji_cloud_50x50.png)![EmojiCloud](/emoji_cloud_50x50.png)

## Open Source: The New Standard

Open source is now mainstream among enterprises. It’s essential to test new implementations thoroughly before production and to hire the right experts for deployment and optimization—SLA included.

## Missed Opportunities

Suse seems to be pivoting to Kubernetes—perhaps a missed chance to lead the market?

> Remember YAST? Yet Another Supreme Tisaster.

## Security

Security wasn’t a major focus at the event, though the “Writing an exploit using AI” workshop caught my eye—unfortunately, time didn’t permit a visit.
